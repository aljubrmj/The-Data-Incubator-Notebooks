    "It's the interview question many aspiring data scientists dread: what algorithm should you choose and why? \n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, it's a bit of an unfair question. We rarely have all of the answers _before_ analyzing the data. If we did, we wouldn't need Machine Learning algorithms to begin with. In practice, you shouldn't be afraid to try different options and use cross validation to determine which is best. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, this is a great opportunity to show off what you know, and your ability to give a practical answer has the potential to make you stand out from other candidates. The key is to know the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and to recommend those that best match the data being considered. This will also help you to explore options more efficiently in a practical setting. There are endless ways to modify and combine the techniques we've learned, so 'just try everything' isn't really a practical option.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explore which algorithms and techniques are most likely to be effective in a variety of circumstances. It can be thought of as a cheat sheet or shortcut towards answering the question posed above, but we challenge you to internalize the material and form your own opinions about how Machine Learning problems ought to be approached. You may find it helpful to try answering each question on your own (or discussing with a friend) before reading our answers. \n",

    "* **Dimension Reduction/Feature Selection/Regularization** - These are all reasonable methods to combat overfitting, which may occur if too many features are used.

To a limited extent they are handled automatically by tree-based methods.\n",
    "* **Complicated Underlying Behavior** - For harder problems, we need to use fancier models. See 'Best Predictions' in the previous section. Feature engineering can also help when we have some insight about what the model ought to be looking for.  In some cases, we can try combining the predictions of many (usually simple) models and passing them as features to a final regressor or classifier (using the `FeatureUnion` method from Scikit-learn). Using a linear model is equivalent to taking a weighted average of the contributors, whereas a more complex final estimator is capable of combining the component models nonlinearly. \n",
    "* **Bad Encodings** - Data needs to be represented in a format that your algorithm can exploit. For example, if you're using Linear Regression, it would be a bad idea to represent ice cream flavors using the numbers $1-10$. There's no order relation between flavors and we'd like to be able to treat each as a separate case, so one-hot encoding is likely a better option. This is a very general concept; you should always think about what representations are appropriate when working with new data types. \n",
    "* **Missing Information** - We may simply lack the information we need to make good predictions. Additional features are sometimes the answer, but you need to be realistic about what you can accomplish.

    "* **Data Augmentation** - It's harder to overfit when we have more data, so one strategy is to add artificial observations at the cost of lower data quality. We can add noise to existing observations or randomly drop feature values. This prevents the model from becoming too sensitive (but may increase underfitting)."

Also, while Naive Bayes methods are generally decent classifiers, they are typically poor estimators, so the probability outputs from these methods should not be taken seriously.  \n",
