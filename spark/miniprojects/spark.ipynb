    "From your trained Word2Vec model, pass the vectors into a K-means clustering algorithm. Create a plot of the sum of squared error by calculating the square root of the sum of the squared distances for each point and its assigned cluster. For an independent variable use either the number of clusters k or the dimension of the Word2Vec vectorization."
