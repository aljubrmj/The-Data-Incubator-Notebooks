    "- **Transformations:** This creates a new RDD from an old one: for instance `map` or `flatMap`.  Transformations in Spark are __lazy__, which means that they do not compute the answer right away -- only when it is needed by something else.  Instead they represent the \"idea\" of the transformation applied to the base data set (e.g. for each chaining).  In particular, this means that intermediate results to computations do not necessarily get created and stored -- if the output of your map is going straight into a reduce, Spark should be clever enough to realize this and not actually store the output of the map.  Another consequence of this design is that the results of transformations are, by default, recomputed each time they are needed -- to store them one must explicitly call `cache`.\n",
    "    \n",

Common examples include `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, and also `join`, `cogroup`, `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`, `countByKey`, and `sample`.\n",

    "    \n",
