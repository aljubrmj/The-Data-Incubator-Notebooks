    "The overwhelming majority of software development is conducted in Unix-like operating systems. The most common Unix-like operating systems today are Linux and Mac OS. Windows is not Unix-like, although such an environment is available on Windows systems via Cygwin or (as of Windows 10) the Windows Subsystem for Linux. While graphical user interfaces (GUIs) exist for modern operating systems, many software development (and data manipulation) tasks involve complex, ad-hoc operations on the file system. Such operations are typically difficult or impossible to accomplish through the GUI. Instead developers tend to interact with the operating system using a terminal.\n",
