    "Traffic between two computers can easily be encrypted using [symmetric-key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm). However, while this secures the traffic between the two computers, the connection between client and server is only truly secure if both parties to authenticate their identity to the other. This is done using [public-key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the server generates a pair of cryptographic keys, one private and one public. When the client tries to connect to the server, the server sends the client a message signed with the server's private key. The client keeps a record of public keys from servers it has connected to. The client uses this server's public key to verify that the signature is authentic. Importantly, while the public key can be used to verify the signature, it cannot be used to compute what the private key is. This authenticates that the server is what the client believes, and that the client's request to connect isn't being intercepted by an imposter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client can authenticate its identity to the server in one of two ways: via a password or using public-key encryption. Password authentication simply involves the client sending the appropriate password for the user account it's requesting to access on the server. The public-key encryption process is very similar to the public-key encryption process the server uses to authenticate its identity to the client. The client generates a pair of cryptographic keys, one private and one public. The server administrator must add the public key to a record of authorized keys allowed to connect to the server. The client then sends the server a message signed with the client's private key. The server can then use the client's public key to verify the signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any authentication takes place, all traffic between client and server is encrypted with a symmetric-key algorithm established at the beginning of the process. This protects the authentication process from eavesdropping. Encrypting the authentication process is particularly important for password authentication, since an eavesdropper could easily intercept the password. It is less important for public-key encryption, since the private key is never transmitted and cannot be determined from the signed messages or the public key used for authentication."

    "The most basic way to establish an SSH connection is by logging into a user account on the remote computer using the account's password. The format used is `ssh username@ipaddress`. If it is your first time connecting to the server, SSH will ask if you want to add it to your known hosts. The server will prompt you to enter the password for the user account you are trying to access. Once successfully logged in your terminal will display a shell prompt for the user on the remote machine."
