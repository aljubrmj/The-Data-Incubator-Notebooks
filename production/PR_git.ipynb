    "Remotes allow us to have a local repository that tracks another repository (which does not have to live on the same computer).  This is the basis behind sites such as [GitHub](https://github.com) which manage repositories in a cloud environment.  Having this centralized repository means that there is a single source of truth and the local repositories are just copies of this repo, albeit not in general in the most recent state.  One nice thing about git in particular (this is not true of all version control software) is that it allows complete independence from the remote repository during development until we want to add our changes to the central source\n",

For example if we wanted to clone the repository for `requests` which is an open source Python package for making web requests (also generally regarded as a model of proper Python development), we could simply run\n",
