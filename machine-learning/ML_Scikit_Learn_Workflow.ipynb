It should help you get the basics down for implementing sklearn's interface, but you might run into some weird issues, or this validation might be \"too much\" for the pipeline you're trying to build or even not general enough for something that might be compatible. You might actually have something that's compatible with `GridSearchCV` for example, and would still fail validation here (e.g. input validation below).\n",
