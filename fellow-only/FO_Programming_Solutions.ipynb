    "1.  As you can see here, we still need to actually implement the `merge` method to construct a new \"well-balanced\" binary search tree.  `merge_trees` gives the list of combined elements in sorted order of both trees.  An additional method is required to construct the tree itself.  \n",
    "1.  An unstated assumption in the implementation above is that the two merged trees don't share any common values in the nodes.  Indeed, the typical definition of a binary search tree is that the values stored in them have no repeats.  While the `merge_lists` method will work just fine with repeated values (meaning that the resulting merged list will be correctly sorted having the repeated values), we'd have to modify `merge_lists` to only keep one copy of repeated values.  \n",
    "1.  Interested readers are referred to [AVL Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) and similar structures like [Red-black Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) for further discussion about \"self-balancing trees\".  \n",
    "1.  The usual way to construct a balanced binary search tree (such as an AVL tree) would give you an algorithm that is $O(n\\log n)$, since the final step of building the tree will have that time complexity.  "
