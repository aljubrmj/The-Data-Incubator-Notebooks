We suggest that everyone should solve the problem on their own, timed (give yourself 5 minutes), preferably while standing.  You want to feel as comfortable with this as possible because you will be much more nervous when you interview.  You can discuss the problems afterwards.*\n",

    "1. Decide on the basic format of your presentation (website, `ipynb` etc.).  Build a bare-bones version of your website / `ipynb` with some fake data, which are the results you think you'll get.  Your work should tell a story and all the supporting points (there should be at most 3) need to reinforce this story.  Think about how you would present your results.  What kind of graph or visualizations would you need?  Plan your analysis accordingly.\n",

    "2. Introduce your project for The Data Incubator.  Why is it important to businesses?  (\"My Data Incubator project uses machine learning to identify the cutest cat videos on the internet\").\n",
    "3. Talk through two to three \"analytical\" or \"engineering\" points that were *interesting*.  Great lines feel like this:\n",
    "    - We looked at 5 million user reviews collected over 4 years on Yelp.\n",
    "    - I'm using Mongo, a No-SQL data store, to make my webpage load faster.  \n",
